A tool to parse context free grammars into JavaScript: inspired by http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/01/28/generating-random-sentences-from-a-context-free-grammar/

The program ships with a grammar file which produces parodies of [Talen Lee's HackCPC synopsis](http://press.arts-eclectic.com/twitter-fanfiction/): parody is, I think, fair use.
